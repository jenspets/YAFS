One way to run the code:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/YAFS/src/
cd YAFS/tutorial_scenarios/02_serviceMovement/
python main.py
```


The project contains the next files:

```
├── data
│   ├── allocDefinition.json
│   ├── appDefinition.json
│   └── usersDefinition.json
├── logFile.log
├── logging.ini
├── main.py
├── readme.md
└── results
    ├── graph_binomial_tree_5
    ├── sim_trace.csv
    └── sim_trace_link.csv
```

- main.py controls this simulation and generates all the pieces.
- data/allocDefinition.json defines the allocation of app's instances
- data/appDefinition.json defines the description of the applications
- data/usersDefinition.json defines the allocation of the "users" 
- results/graph_binomial_tree_5 a figure of the resulting topology using NetworkX functions.
- results/sim_trace.csv the simulation traces, it contains the requests handled by each instance along the simulation.
- results/sim_trace_link.csv the simlation traces, it contains the network messages between the nodes generated by the requests.
  
  
### The service movement
It is defined by the next code in main.py file:

```
    """
    This internal monitor in the simulator (a DES process) changes the sim's behaviour. 
    You can have multiples monitors doing different or same tasks.
    
    In this case, it changes the service's allocation, the node where the service is.

    dist = deterministicDistributionStartPoint(stop_time/4., stop_time/2.0/10.0, name="Deterministic")
    evol = CustomStrategy(folder_results)
    s.deploy_monitor("RandomAllocation",
                     evol,
                     dist,
                     **{"sim": s, "routing": selectorPath}) # __call__ args
